# Lucky_number

## Working:
This application will ask the user to enter his/her name. Then the user have to press button "wish me a luck", then we will be directed to another activity generating a random number

This application will allow the user to share the result among other applications that are available on the device.
we can copy and share to e-mail, Bluetooth, Goodle drive and other application.

## What we will learn ?
• In this application we will learn how to get the data from the edit text.

• How to pass the data among the intents.

• How to paas and share that data among other applications, using "Implicit intent" & "Explicit intents"

## Step 1: Set Layout for MainActivity
Go to "acitvity_main.xml" create TextView
This View will display the text on the screen when you open application

set layout width and height to wrap_content.
set id.
Set android text.
set layout margin if needed.

Then finally click set all constrains.

• Similarly create EditText View:
  This View will allow user to Enter their name

To showcase what user have to enter, set hint = "Enter your name"
Next all process is similar to Textview

• Now to Create a Button

  This Button will take user to the secondActivity.
  set Button id.
  set button text.
  and set constraints.
